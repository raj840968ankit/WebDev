The simplest "Hello, World!" program in Java requires a class and a `main` method. However, to demonstrate good
practices even in a small program, let's structure it more robustly, anticipating potential issues and making it easily
expandable.

**1. Project Structure:**

We'll create a simple project structure, even for this small program. This is crucial for scalability. For larger
projects, you'd use build tools like Maven or Gradle, but for this example, a simple directory structure will suffice.

```
helloworld/
├── src/
│ └── main/
│ └── java/
│ └── com/
│ └── example/
│ └── HelloWorld.java
└── run.sh (or run.bat for Windows)
```

**2. HelloWorld.java:**

```java
package com.example;

// Import necessary classes for handling potential exceptions (though not strictly needed for this simple example, good
practice)
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

public class HelloWorld {

/**
* Main method - entry point of the program.
* Uses try-with-resources for automatic resource management. Handles potential IOExceptions during output.
* @param args Command line arguments (not used in this example)
*/
public static void main(String[] args) {
// Improved output handling - Writing to standard output (console) is done here in try-with-resources to make sure that
resources are closed properly after the use
try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(System.out)) {
writer.println("Hello, World!"); //Using PrintWriter for flexibility, especially important when dealing with larger
applications or file output
} catch (Exception e) {
System.err.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage()); //Improved error handling
}
}
}
```

**3. `run.sh` (or `run.bat`):**

This script simplifies compilation and execution:

**run.sh (Linux/macOS):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
javac src/main/java/com/example/HelloWorld.java
java com.example.HelloWorld
```

**run.bat (Windows):**

```batch
@echo off
javac src\main\java\com\example\HelloWorld.java
java com.example.HelloWorld
```

**Explanation:**

* **Package Declaration:** `package com.example;` Organizes the code into a package, preventing naming conflicts. This
is good practice from the start.
* **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block handles potential `IOExceptions` during output, although unlikely in this
simple case, it is crucial habit for robust code.
* **Resource Management:** `try-with-resources` ensures that the `PrintWriter` is closed automatically, even if
exceptions occur. This prevents resource leaks.
* **PrintWriter:** `PrintWriter` provides more control over output than `System.out.println()`, particularly useful when
writing to files or handling different character encodings.
* **Compilation and Execution:** The shell scripts handle the compilation and execution steps, making it easier to run
the code.

Remember to make the `run.sh` (or `run.bat`) file executable: `chmod +x run.sh` (Linux/macOS).


This enhanced example, while seemingly more complex for a "Hello, World!" program, establishes crucial best practices
that are essential for larger, more intricate Java projects. It promotes maintainability, scalability, and error
resilience.
