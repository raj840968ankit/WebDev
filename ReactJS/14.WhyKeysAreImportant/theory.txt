//.......................................Why keys are important..........................................................
//we use keys always with an array (react uses map method for array traversal)
//keys make the items in array unique (don't prefer array index as key)

//...................Problem when we set array index as key.......................................
//it will work fine when we add an item to the last of array, because new key will be given to the element

//it will not work fine when we add an item to starting of the array because :-
//   - if we put an an item at the start of array then that element key will be 0 and all other element's key will increment by 1
//   - react will change the text node of every element  just because of key disorder(not best practice)
