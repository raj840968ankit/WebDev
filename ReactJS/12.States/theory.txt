//States refers to an object which holds the information about components and whenever the state changes then react re-render the components

//..............................Using State..............................................
//check usage in react-thapa -> src -> components -> hooks -> State.jsx

//suppose after clicking on a button we are supposed to render change on web page
//but the change in value doesn't reflect on page because react js can't understand and reflect change of normal variable
//console.log(value);   //change in variable can only be seen in console.

//therefore for mitigation of above issue we will use ...'useState'... hook
//first import {useState} from 'react'
//syntax -  "const [variable, function] = useState(initialValueForVariable)"

//whenever we will click the button we will implement the function of useState that take callback to increment the variable value
//and after that we will render that value


//.........................Important Note about state.................................
// we have DOM tree initially but when the useState function is called then react js creates a new tree
// after that diff algorithm will work and check which component is changing
// after that react render that current component and its children component only...not any sibling components
