    <h3>Premier</h3>
    <p>Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring superheroes, Marvel Comics set about creating new superhero characters. During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.[1] Lee wanted to design a character who should have been unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the character anyway.</p>
     
    <h3>Solo series</h3>
    <p>As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes. The monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense began running Iron Man stories alongside more traditional science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover.</p>
    <h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
