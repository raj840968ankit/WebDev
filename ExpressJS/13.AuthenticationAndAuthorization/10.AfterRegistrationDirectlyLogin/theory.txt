//................Auto login directly after signup only(no need for manual login).............................
//Think what we done in signup-----------------
//   - get user, email and password
//   - check for same email existing user converted password to hash password
//   - saved in database 

//Think what we done in login-----------------
//   - get user email and password
//   - get user by email from database
//   - compare with hashed password
//   - created session and tokens
//   - send cookie 


//In login step we were doing extra things like reading user from database and comparing password then giving access with tokens and session


//.....................KeY Idea for direct login after registration (modern approach).....................................
//   - after saving user details in database in registration steps we can directly create sessions and tokens
//   - and send cookies to user

//....................How to do these things.........................
//   -copy session and token creation, cookie sending from postLogin
//   -use copied code in registration directly after saving details of new user
//   -cross check every variable after pasting code
