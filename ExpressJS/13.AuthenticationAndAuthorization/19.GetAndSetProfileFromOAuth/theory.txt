//the basic key idea is :-
//   - we will request profile from OAuth platform
//   - save that profile in usersTable after adding a profile attribute(avatar_url)
//   - retrieve profile from usersTable while setting profile pic

// How to do this - 
//   - add a attribute to usersTable 'avatarURL'
//   - check usage in '/google/callback' during 'claims' (also check in '/github/callback')
//   - save picture only if user doesn't linked with OAuth
//   - go to getProfilePage Route and then set profile picture
