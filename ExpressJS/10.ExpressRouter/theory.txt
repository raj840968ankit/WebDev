//A router in expressJS is used to define modules and reusable routes in expressJS

//it is created by 'express.Router()'

//router can be defined using 'router.get()' and 'router.post()'

//router can be mounted in main app using 'app.use('/basepath', router)'

//......To see example then goto URLShortener project in 'routes folder'(initially created to use router)
//      1.create 'routes' folder
//      2.create 'routerFileName.routes.js' file
//      3.cut content and paste in router file (get, post) only
//      4.create router instance using express.Router()
//      5.replace app with router
//      6.export router to use in app.js
//      7.use router using app.use(exported router)
//      8.if any path related problem then send req.appRoute using middleware and can be accessed in only req-res cycle(get and post method only)
