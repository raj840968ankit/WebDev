/*
    -MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). 
    -It is document-oriented, meaning data is stored as documents in collections instead of rows and tables. 
    -MongoDB supports dynamic schemas, allowing fields to vary between documents in the same collection. 
    -MongoDB provides features like indexing, aggregation pipelines, and replication for high performance and reliability. 
    -Commonly used for applications requiring flexible data models
*/

--Collection - group of documents (similar to tables in SQL)
--document - basic unit of data (similar to a entry in table in SQL but in key-value pair)
